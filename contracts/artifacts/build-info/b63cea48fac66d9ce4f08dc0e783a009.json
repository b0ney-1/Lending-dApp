This means\n that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.\n TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide\n https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How\n to implement supply mechanisms].\n The default value of {decimals} is 18. To change this, you should override\n this function so it returns a different value.\n We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert\n instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless\n conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20\n applications.\n Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.\n This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just\n by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit\n these events, as it isn't required by the specification."

								"text": " @dev Interface of the ERC20 Permit extension allowing approvals to be made via signatures, as defined in\n https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612[EIP-2612].\n Adds the {permit} method, which can be used to change an account's ERC20 allowance (see {IERC20-allowance}) by\n presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't\n need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.\n ==== Security Considerations\n There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature\n expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be\n considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have\n built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should\n take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be\n generally recommended is:\n ```solidity\n function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {\n     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}\n     doThing(..., value);\n }\n function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {\n     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);\n     ...\n }\n ```\n Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of\n `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also\n {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit."

Additionally, a\n fallback mechanism can be used for every other case.\n Usage example:\n ```solidity\n contract Named {\n     using ShortStrings for *;\n     ShortString private immutable _name;\n     string private _nameFallback;\n     constructor(string memory contractName) {\n         _name = contractName.toShortStringWithFallback(_nameFallback);\n     }\n     function name() external view returns (string memory) {\n         return _name.toStringWithFallback(_nameFallback);\n     }\n }\n ```"

Errors are documented using an enum (error type)\n and a bytes32 providing additional information about the error.\n If no error is returned, then the address can be used for verification purposes.\n The `ecrecover` EVM precompile allows for malleable (non-unique) signatures:\n this function rejects them by requiring the `s` value to be in the lower\n half order, and the `v` value to be either 27 or 28.\n IMPORTANT: `hash` _must_ be the result of a hash operation for the\n verification to be secure: it is possible to craft signatures that\n recover to arbitrary addresses for non-hashed data. A safe way to ensure\n this is by receiving a hash of the original message (which may otherwise\n be too long), and then calling {MessageHashUtils-toEthSignedMessageHash} on it.\n Documentation for signature generation:\n - with https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.3.4/web3-eth-accounts.html#sign[Web3.js]\n - with https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/signer/#Signer-signMessage[ethers]"

This address can then be used for verification purposes.\n The `ecrecover` EVM precompile allows for malleable (non-unique) signatures:\n this function rejects them by requiring the `s` value to be in the lower\n half order, and the `v` value to be either 27 or 28.\n IMPORTANT: `hash` _must_ be the result of a hash operation for the\n verification to be secure: it is possible to craft signatures that\n recover to arbitrary addresses for non-hashed data. A safe way to ensure\n this is by receiving a hash of the original message (which may otherwise\n be too long), and then calling {MessageHashUtils-toEthSignedMessageHash} on it."

Protocols need to implement the type-specific encoding they need in order to\n produce the hash of their typed data using a combination of `abi.encode` and `keccak256`.\n This contract implements the EIP 712 domain separator ({_domainSeparatorV4}) that is used as part of the encoding\n scheme, and the final step of the encoding to obtain the message digest that is then signed via ECDSA\n ({_hashTypedDataV4}).\n The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating\n the chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain.\n NOTE: This contract implements the version of the encoding known as \"v4\", as implemented by the JSON RPC method\n https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html[`eth_signTypedDataV4` in MetaMask].\n NOTE: In the upgradeable version of this contract, the cached values will correspond to the address, and the domain\n separator of the implementation contract. This will cause the {_domainSeparatorV4} function to always rebuild the\n separator from the immutable values, which is cheaper than accessing a cached version in cold storage.\n @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow state-variable-immutable"
